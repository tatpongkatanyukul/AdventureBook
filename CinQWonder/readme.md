N & C:
Postulates
* (p 80) **Postulate 1**: Associated to any isolated physical system is a complex vector space with inner product (that is, a Hilbert space) know as the _state space_ of the system. The system is completely described by its _state vector_, which is a unit vector in the system's state space.
* (p 81) **Postulate 2**: The evolution of a _closed_ quantum system is described by a _unitary transformation_. That is, the state $|\psi\rangle$ of the system at time $t_1$ is related to the state $|\psi'\rangle$ of the system at time $t_2$ by a unitary operator $U$ which depends only on the times $t_1$ adn $t_2$, $|\psi'\rangle = U |\psi\rangle$.
  * (p 82) ***Postulate 2'***: The time evolution of the state of a closed quantum system is described by the _Schrodinger equation_, $i \bar{h} \frac{d |\psi\rangle}{d t} = H |\psi\rangle$.
