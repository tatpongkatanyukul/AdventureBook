[The First Draft](https://github.com/tatpongkatanyukul/AdventureBook/blob/main/Draft1/b202b.pdf), submitted for my sabbatical leave on Dec 8th, 2020.

  * Chapters 1-3 and 5 are quite complete.
  * Chapter 4 needs more applications.
  * Chapter 6 needs Inception for "quite complete". (Codes of Alexnet and Inception are also needed.)
  * Chapter 7 needs more applications. (Coddes are badly needed)
  * Chapters 8-9 needs re-organization and more NLP materials. (Coddes are badly needed)
