  abstract = {Theoretical results suggest that in order to learn the kind of
complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in
vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need {\insist deep
architectures}. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear
operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated
propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the
parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but
learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed
to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art
in certain areas. This paper discusses the motivations and principles regarding 
learning algorithms for deep architectures,  in particular those exploiting as
building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines,
used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.}

Rebecca Saxe: The Brain vs. The Mind 
Cognitive neuroscientist Rebecca Saxe tells Piya Chattopadhyay what the difference is between the brain and the mind, and why this matters in our understanding of human nature.
theagenda.tvo.org

``We know quite a lot about how that experience relates to brain function.
But, we know much less about is how [would] a pattern of electrical activity in a brain cell relates to thinking about morality. ...
What pattern of activity is it ...
